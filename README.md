# solo

SoloDeploy is a CLI tool to initiate and facilitate the flow of deployable artifacts between environments. It implements a basic GitOps inspired CI/CD process to promote and deploy code committing to Git repositories called Manifests.

## Getting started with the source code

* Ensure the correct version of Golang is installed. The version can be found in `./go.mod`.
* Install the dependencies with `go install`.
* Compile the code with `go build`.
* Print the help text with `solo --help`.
* Run the tests with `go test -v ./...`.
